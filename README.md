## Recent projects

About half my work in live video engineering for conferences, concerts and exhibitions, and the rest is custom-built hardware and software solutions.

If you're reading this you'll probably already know what's involved in conference work, so I'll skip that bit. Here's some examples of the custom-built stuff:

---
### Alpine F1 garage (motorsport)

Video and lighting control systems for the Alpine F1 garage, including race engineer integrations, and the most famous curfew timer in F1.

---

### Virgin Media Portl (TV advert)

The latest in a series of brand activations for Nike Dubai. Users can build a custom audio track with associated real-time visuals, then publish and share it via QR code and a custom microsite service.
